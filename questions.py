Questionnaire Data Module
=========================
Contains all questionnaire items for both User and Non-User groups.
Questions are stored in ordered dictionaries to maintain correct sequencing.
All question text is preserved verbatim from the validated research instrument.

Response Scales:
    Likert (7-point, default — used for all sections including Personality):
        1 = Strongly Disagree
        2 = Disagree
        3 = Slightly Disagree
        4 = Neutral
        5 = Slightly Agree
        6 = Agree
        7 = Strongly Agree

    AI vs Human Trust (7-point):
        1 = Trust Human Much More
        2 = Trust Human More
        3 = Trust Human Slightly More
        4 = Trust Both Equally
        5 = Trust AI Slightly More
        6 = Trust AI More
